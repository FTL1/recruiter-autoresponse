# recruiter-autoresponse
Based on the Medium Article entitled - "Career Advice Nobody Gave Me: Never ignore a recruiter" this repo has a copyable script which you can use to auto-respond to recruiters.

This is licensed under MIT so please feel free to fork and use as you'd like. 

If you like it, please consider leaving a github star.  I think that it would be super cool to see how many people this helps.

Thanks so much for reaching out. I'm always interested in hearing about what new and exciting opportunities are out there. 

As a technology executive I'm sure you can imagine that I get a high volume of recruiters reaching out on LinkedIn.  This is a wonderful position of privilege to be in and I'm greatful to God for it. However,  this also means I don't have the luxury of time to hop on a call with everyone who reaches out. Often, incoming requests represent a very poor fit.

I am happy to extend our conversation beyond this message, but before I do, I must insist we clarify the seniority, talent set, and opportunity you are describing. This this end: please send along the company name, detailed job description (including expectations, location, etc.) and total compensation details for the role you're reaching out in reference to. 

While I very much appreciate the fact that exceptionally talented and engaged recruiters reach out thoughtfully, sorting serious, high quality opportunities from spam would be a full time job without an autoresponder.

In the absence of detailed information (indicated above) regarding the nature of the opportunity in question, I will be unavailable for further discussion.

Thanks again for reaching out and I look forward to hearing from you!
