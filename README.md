Hi <insert-solicitor-here>

As an experienced technology executive I'm sure you can imagine I hear from many recruiters on LinkedIn. This is a real privilege for which I am grateful to God and to the freedom American Individual Liberty provides.  It does mean however I donâ€™t have time to hop on a call with everyone who reaches out. Often, incoming requests represent a poor fit.

I am happy to extend our conversation beyond this message, before doing so I must insist upon clarification of the opportunity you are presenting.  To this end, please reply with the company name, detailed job description and total compensation for the role you're reaching out in reference to.

While I very much appreciate the fact that exceptionally talented and engaged recruiters reach out thoughtfully, sorting the serious, high quality, opportunities from (prodigious) spam would occupy too much of my time without this autoresponder.  In the absence of the detailed information regarding the nature of the opportunity (as indicated above), I will be unavailable for further discussion.

Thanks again for reaching out and I look forward to hearing from you!

Liberty & Regard
Clay
