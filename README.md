# recruiter-autoresponse
Based on the Medium Article entitled - "Career Advice Nobody Gave Me: Never ignore a recruiter" this repo has a copyable script which you can use to auto-respond to recruiters.

This is licensed under MIT so please feel free to fork and use as you'd like. 

If you like it, please consider leaving a github star.  I think that it would be super cool to see how many people this helps.

Thanks for reaching out. I am interested in hearing about the new and exciting opportunities available out there. 

As an experienced technology executive I'm sure you can imagine I hear from many recruiters on LinkedIn.  This is a real privilege for which I am greatful to God and to the freedom American Individual Liberty provides. It does mean however I donâ€™t have the time to hop on a call with everyone who reaches out. Often, incoming requests represent a poor fit.

I am happy to extend our conversation beyond this message, before doing so I must insist upon clarification of the opportunity you are presenting.  To this end, please send along the *company name*, *detailed* job description and *total compensation* for the role you're reaching out in reference to. 

While I very much appreciate the fact that exceptionally talented and engaged recruiters reach out thoughtfully, sorting the serious, high quality, opportunities from the (prodigous) spam would occupy too much of my time without this autoresponder. 

In the absence of the detailed information (outlined above) regarding the nature of the opportunity in question, I will be unavailable for further discussion.

Thanks again for reaching out and I look forward to hearing from you!

Liberty & Regard
Clay
